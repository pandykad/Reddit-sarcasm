## Introduction\n\n
Sarcasm detection is a challenging NLP task due to its subjective nature and reliance on context. This project explores sarcasm detection using a deep learning approach, employing a neural network model to classify Reddit comments.\n

## Features\n\n
- **Data Preprocessing**: Text cleaning, tokenization, and lemmatization to prepare data for model training.\n
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visualizations and statistical analysis to understand the dataset.\n
- **Deep Learning Model**: Implementation of an LSTM-based neural network model using Keras and TensorFlow.\n
- **Model Training**: Utilization of various techniques like early stopping and learning rate reduction to optimize model performance.\n
- **Evaluation**: Performance metrics and model evaluation on a test dataset.\n

## Installation\n\n
To run this project, you'll need Python and the following libraries:\n\n
- `numpy`\n
- `pandas`\n
- `matplotlib`\n
- `nltk`\n
- `tensorflow`\n
- `keras`\n
- `scikit-learn`\n\n
You can install these dependencies using pip:\n\n
```bash\npip install numpy pandas matplotlib nltk tensorflow keras scikit-learn\n```\n,
  
## Usage\n\n
1. **Clone the repository**:\n\n
   ```bash\n   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sarcasm-detection.git\n   cd sarcasm-detection\n   ```\n\n
2. **Prepare the data**: Ensure you have the Reddit comments dataset. This dataset should be cleaned and formatted as required by the notebook.\n\n
3. **Run the notebook**: Use Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment to run the `sarcasm_detection.ipynb` notebook. Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.\n

## Data\n\n
The data used in this project consists of Reddit comments. The dataset should be a CSV file with two columns: one for the comment text and one for the sarcasm label.\n\n
Ensure your data is preprocessed as follows:\n
- **Text Cleaning**: Removal of special characters, numbers, and excessive whitespace.\n
- **Tokenization and Lemmatization**: Converting text to lowercase and breaking it into tokens (words), followed by lemmatization to reduce words to their base forms.\n

## Model Architecture\n\n
The sarcasm detection model is built using an LSTM-based neural network architecture, leveraging word embeddings to capture semantic meaning. The architecture includes:\n- **Embedding Layer**: Converts words into dense vectors of fixed size.\n
- **LSTM Layers**: Captures the temporal dependencies in text data.\n
- **Dense Layers**: Final layers to produce the output classification.\n

## Results\n\n
The model is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. Further details and results can be found in the notebook.\n
