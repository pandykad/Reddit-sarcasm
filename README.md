## Introduction  
Sarcasm detection is a challenging NLP task due to its subjective nature and reliance on context. This project explores sarcasm detection using a deep learning approach, employing a neural network model to classify Reddit comments. 

## Features  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Text cleaning, tokenization, and lemmatization to prepare data for model training. 
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visualizations and statistical analysis to understand the dataset. 
- **Deep Learning Model**: Implementation of an LSTM-based neural network model using Keras and TensorFlow. 
- **Model Training**: Utilization of various techniques like early stopping and learning rate reduction to optimize model performance. 
- **Evaluation**: Performance metrics and model evaluation on a test dataset. 

## Installation  
To run this project, you'll need Python and the following libraries:
- `numpy`  
- `pandas`  
- `matplotlib`  
- `nltk`  
- `tensorflow`  
- `keras`  
- `scikit-learn`  
You can install these dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib nltk tensorflow keras scikit-learn
```
  
## Usage  
1. **Clone the repository**:  
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sarcasm-detection.git   
  cd sarcasm-detection
```
2. **Prepare the data**: Ensure you have the Reddit comments dataset. This dataset should be cleaned and formatted as required by the notebook.
3. **Run the notebook**: Use Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment to run the `sarcasm_detection.ipynb` notebook. Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.  

## Data
The data used in this project consists of Reddit comments. The dataset should be a CSV file with two columns: one for the comment text and one for the sarcasm label.
Ensure your data is preprocessed as follows:  
- **Text Cleaning**: Removal of special characters, numbers, and excessive whitespace.  
- **Tokenization and Lemmatization**: Converting text to lowercase and breaking it into tokens (words), followed by lemmatization to reduce words to their base forms.  

## Model Architecture  
The sarcasm detection model is built using an LSTM-based neural network architecture, leveraging word embeddings to capture semantic meaning. The architecture includes:\n- **Embedding Layer**: Converts words into dense vectors of fixed size.  
- **LSTM Layers**: Captures the temporal dependencies in text data.  
- **Dense Layers**: Final layers to produce the output classification.  

## Results  
The model is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. Further details and results can be found in the notebook.
